                    <p>We supply households throughout Switzerland with high-quality and sustainably sourced products for organic, regular and complete weekly shopping. This way, we maintain the variety of products and food producers throughout Switzerland that you can really trust.</p>
                    <p>In doing so, we act according to the motto “As close as possible, as far away as necessary.” At least 50 % of our products come from the region within 80 km of our HUB in Zurich. In addition, we obtain our regional products directly from the producers – and only on the day of delivery. This unique logistics concept without intermediate storage means that your food is 3 to 4 days fresher than in the supermarket. Only what has been ordered is delivered. This saves large refrigeration and storage facilities and avoids food waste.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to our excellent logistics planning tools, our delivery routes are particularly efficient and we deliver to as many customers as possible on one tour. You can return the packaging materials from your shopping to our courier for the next delivery – we will then recycle them for you.</p>

The technology-driven company relies on a sophisticated logistics concept that delivers products freshly and conveniently to customers throughout Switzerland and prevents food waste.</p>
                    <p>As a second pillar, the young company has also founded the all-in-one software solution “Farmy solutions” to help small and medium-sized enterprises get started online. As its first major customer, Alnatura is already on the road in several cities in Germany with its own delivery concept based on the Farmy software.</p>
