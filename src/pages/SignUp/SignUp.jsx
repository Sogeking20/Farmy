          Zurich.
        </p>

        <p>
          These terms and conditions apply in the time the contract was amended
          for all business relations between Farmy (hereinafter we or us) and
          their customers (you).
        </p>

        <p>
          These terms are deemed to have been accepted when ordering goods or
          services. Differing conditions require written confirmation from us.
        </p>

        <h3 id='compatibility'>2. COMPATIBILITY</h3>
        <p>
          The presentation of products in the online shop is not a
          legally-binding resolution, but merely represents a non-binding online
          catalog. Just putting products in the “basket” is not considered a
          binding order. A binding order for the products contained in the
          basket is only completed and valid when clicking the “Order” button on
          the order page. We will then send you an immediate contract
          confirmation via e-mail, with the receipt of the contract. The
          acceptance is subject to the legality and the availability of the
          ordered goods or services. Temporarily not deliverable products will
          have to be reordered by you. The availability display in the online
          store serves as information, not as a delivery confirmation, it may be
          inaccurate in exceptional cases. Price fluctuations in products are
          possible due to harvest or currency fluctuations. Decisive is the
          contract price specified at the time. A maximum of one customer
          account per household/company is permitted, unless agreed in writing
          and by mutual consent.

        <p>
          We will deliver the ordered goods to the address specified in the
          order at the time specified in the order. In exceptional cases,
          certain products may not be available, but may be replaced by another
          producer who can supply the same product in the same quality (same
          certificate). In this case you will be informed about the substitute
          via e-mail. If you do not agree to the exchange, please contact our
          customer care for a reimbursement We are entitled to make partial
          deliveries and services at any given time. If partial deliveries are
          carried out by us, we reimburse the missing product or if a
          complementary delivery is possible, we do assume the additional
          postage.. If you should not be home at the time of delivery, we do
          have your permission to place the goods in front of the door,
          respectively to execute your note regarding the placement of your
          order, which you can leave when submitting the order. Our frozen
          products are delivered in cooling bags with dry ice, so that they
          remain frozen when they reach you. For this we charge a dry ice flat
          rate of CHF 5. Caution is required upon receipt of dry ice products!
          Use gloves! Dry ice = -78°C! Direct contact with unprotected skin can
          result in serious frostbite. Dry ice is not to be toyed with and
          should be kept away from children! We guarantee the cold chain until
          delivery and do not carry any responsibility after that. The delivery
          is defined as «a delivery to the front door». If requested by the
          customer and under conditions of liability for any damage resulting
          from mistreatment or the like, we deliver to the apartment, this means
          we go through the front door to place the goods, e.g. on the kitchen
          table.

        <p>
          This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by
          Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”,
          text files that are stored on your computer to help analyse your use
          of the website. The information gathered by the cookie about your use
          of this website is generally transmitted to and stored in a Google
          server in the USA. If IP anonymization is activated on this website,
          however, your IP address will be stored by Google in shortened form
          within Member States of the European Union or in other States that are
          contracting parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
          Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a
          Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will use this
          information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your
          use of the website, compile reports on website activity and provide
          the website operator with other services related to website usage and

        <p>Credit assessments and scoring</p>

        <p>
          Credit checks and scoring Unless we have paid in advance, for example
          when making a purchase on account, we get to preserve our legitimate
          interests and if appropriate obtain credit information based on
          mathematical statistical methods from a bureau [optional: name of the
          bureau]. In order to effectuate this, we transmit the personal data
          required for a credit rating check to a relevant agency and we use the
          feedback information on the statistical probability of default to
          reach a balanced decision on the conclusion, execution or termination
          of the contract. The credit report can include probability values
          (scores), which are calculated on the basis of scientifically
          recognised mathematical and statistical methods. Other address
          information may also be taken into consideration in the calculations.
          Your legitimate interests will be taken into account in accordance
          with the legal requirements. If we have paid in advance, for example
          in the case of a purchase on account, in order to safeguard our
          legitimate interests, we might obtain a credit rating report from a
          relevant agency, drawn up using mathematical and statistical methods.
          In order to effectuate this, we transmit the personal data required
          for a credit rating check to a relevant agency and we use the feedback
          information on the statistical probability of default to reach a
          balanced decision on the conclusion, execution or termination of the
          contract. Upon request, we shall be more than happy to inform the
          customer as to which agencies we use for this purpose.

        <p>Facebook Social Plugins</p>

        <p>
          On our site, so-called Social Plugins (“Plugins”) of the social
          network Facebook are used, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
          California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are
          marked with a Facebook logo or the words “social plug-in from
          Facebook” or “Facebook Social Plugin”. You can find an overview of
          Facebook plugins and their appearance here:
          http://developers.facebook.com/plugins When you visit a page of our
          website that contains a social plugin, your browser makes a direct
          link to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transferred
          from Facebook directly to your browser, which then embeds it into the
          page. Through the integrated plugin, Facebook receives the information
          that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website,
          even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not currently logged
          in to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is
          transmitted from your browser directly to a Facebook server in the USA
          and stored there. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can
          directly link your visit to our site to your Facebook profile. If you
          interact with the plugins, for example press the “Like” button or make
          a comment, this information is also transmitted directly to a Facebook
          server and stored there. The information is also posted on your
          Facebook profile and displayed to your Facebook friends. To see the
          purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and
          use of data by Facebook, and your rights and settings options to
          protect your privacy, please refer to the privacy policies of
          Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php If you do not want
          Facebook to directly associate the information gathered through our
          website with your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook
          before visiting our website. You can also completely prevent the
          loading of the Facebook plug-ins by applying add-ons to your browser,
          for example “Facebook Blocker”
          (http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/).

        <p>Twitter plugins (e.g. “Tweet” button)</p>

        <p>
          Our website uses so called social plugins from the Twitter
          micro-blogging service, which is operated by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market
          St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (“Twitter”). The plugins
          are marked with a Twitter logo, for example, in the form of a blue
          “Twitter bird”. You can find an overview of the Twitter plugins and
          their appearance here: https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons
          When you visit a page of our website that contains a social plugin,
          your browser makes a direct connection to the servers of Twitter. The
          content of the plugin is transferred from Twitter directly to your
          browser, which then embeds it into the page. By means of this
          integration Twitter receives the information that your browser has
          accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not
          have a profile on Twitter or are currently not logged in to Twitter.
          This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your
          browser directly to a Twitter server in the USA and stored there. If
          you are logged in to Twitter, Twitter can link your visit to our site
          to your Twitter account directly. If you interact with the plugins,
          for example by pressing the “Tweet” button, the corresponding
          information is also transmitted directly to a Twitter server and
          stored there. The information is also published on your Twitter
          account and displayed to your contacts there. To see the purpose and
          scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by
          Twitter, and your rights and settings options to protect your privacy,
          please refer to the privacy policies of Twitter:
          https://twitter.com/privacy If you do not want the data Twitter
          collected on our web directly assigned to your Twitter account, you
          must log out before you visit our website at Twitter. You can
          completely block the loading of plugins with add-ons for your browser,
          e.g. the script blocker “NoScript” (http://noscript.net/).

        <p>
          Alcoholic beverages are not sold to customers under the age of 18. The
          customer has to confirm accordingly that he is 18 years or older
          during the ordering process. If this minimum age is not reached, the
          customer’s offer is not accepted and the contract will not be issued.
          The customer is obliged to provide truthful information about himself.
          Farmy reserves the right to request an ID card copy by mail for the
          determination of the age, without giving reasons. If your order
          includes goods whose sale is subject to age restrictions, we ensure
          that the customer has reached the minimum age requirement through the
          use of a reliable method involving a personal identity and age
          verification. The delivery person shall hand over the goods personally
          and only after age verification of the purchaser.

        <p>
          You must have a Farmy account to subscribe to and use the Farmy Pass.
          We reserve the right to accept or refuse subscriptions at our
          discretion. Your contract for your Farmy Pass will begin once you
          receive email confirmation of your Farmy Pass subscription. You may
          not transfer or assign your subscription or the benefits of such a
          subscription. You accept and acknowledge that the purchase of a Farmy
          Pass entitles Farmy customers to benefits and discounts when you make
          further purchases at Farmy.
        </p>

        <p>MEMBERSHIP FEE, CANCELLATION AND RENEWAL</p>

        <p>
          The Farmy Pass subscription fee is the price displayed on the Farmy
          website at the time you purchase your Farmy Pass subscription or when
          your subscription is renewed. This fee is non-refundable. If you wish
          to cancel your Farmy Pass at any other time please contact our
          customer support until 10 p.m. on the eve of the renewal. Your Farmy
          Pass subscription will be automatically renewed monthly, or every 6 or
          12 months at the end of your minimum term (depending on the type of
          subscription you have purchased). We will contact you by email to
          remind you of this 7 days prior to the relevant renewal date. Unless
          you notify us before renewal that you wish to cancel your
          subscription, you understand that your subscription will automatically
          renew and you authorise us to collect the then-applicable subscription
          fee from the payment card we have on record for you. Your initial
          subscription to a Farmy Pass is an authorisation for us to use this
          payment card. If, before renewal, you decide to cancel your Farmy Pass
          subscription or you do not want to automatically renew, please call
          our customer support. Farmy reserves the right to change the
          subscription fee for future renewals or subscriptions from time to
          time. Farmy Pass subscription fee changes will not take effect until
          the end of the relevant minimum term and we will contact you by email
          giving you 7 days notice of any change in fees before they go into
          effect. Your continued subscription in any of the Farmy Pass
          subscription schemes after we change the subscription fees constitutes
          your acceptance of these changes and the payment card we have on
          record for you will be used to collect the new subscription fee. If
          you do not agree to any fee changes, then you must cancel your
          subscription by contacting our customer support. Your Farmy Pass
          subscription begins on the day that Farmy confirms that your
          subscription has been activated, and expires on the day before the
          date you originally purchased your Farmy Pass subscription unless such
          a date does not exist. If this is the case, then the renewal date is
          set to be the previous calendar day. For example, if your Farmy Pass
          subscription is due to be renewed on the 31st day of a month, there
          will be some instances when it will be renewed on the 30th day of a
          month.
        </p>

        <p>Farmy Hofpass holders:</p>

          The Hofpass will henceforth be referred to as the Farmy Pass and can
          be used as before until the end of the respective Hofpass
          subscription. Farmy will send you a reminder email 7 days in advance
          regarding the renewal of your Farmy Pass.

          Farmy Pass. We reserve the right to change or withdraw your Farmy Pass
          subscription benefits (or any element of them) at any time. For those
          subscriptions with a minimum term, such changes will not take effect
          until the end of the relevant minimum term and we will contact you by
          email giving you 7 days notice of any such changes. In the case of
          subscriptions with no minimum term, Farmy will contact you by email
          giving you 7 days notice of any change to your subscription benefits
          before they go into effect. If you feel that a change to your Farmy
          Pass benefits is to your disadvantage, please contact our customer
          support. Otherwise, your continued subscription after we notify you
          shall constitute your acceptance of these changes and you acknowledge
          that your right to these benefits will cease at the end of the notice
          period. Farmy will not be liable for any losses resulting from any
          changes to, or termination or withdrawal of, any Farmy Pass benefits.
          All orders that make use of your Farmy Pass must meet all of Farmy’s
          Terms &amp; Conditions of Purchase, including any minimum purchase
          order requirements after the relevant Farmy Pass discounts have been
          deducted. It is your responsibility to inform us of any change of
          address and to always enter the correct address at the checkout so
          that we can ensure that deliveries are made to the correct address.

        <p>TERMINATION</p>

        <p>
          Farmy reserves the right to monitor usage of the Farmy Pass service
          and to terminate such subscriptions (upon notice) if it believes, in
          its sole discretion:
        </p>

        <p>
          • the subscription is being used in breach of the fair usage policy; •
          a customer is in breach of any other of the Terms &amp; Conditions
          relating to the Farmy Pass or the Farmy Terms &amp; Conditions of
          Purchase; or • a Farmy Pass subscriber has engaged in conduct that
          involves fraud or misuse of a Farmy Pass subscription or is harmful to
          our interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case of such termination by Farmy, no refund will be given. If
          orders are not paid for in full or a customer’s bank declines payment
          on a customer’s bankcard and as a result money is owing to Farmy, then
          Farmy reserves the right to suspend the customer’s ability to place
          further orders on the Farmy website until such time as the outstanding
          balance has been paid in full. In this event, the Farmy Pass
          subscriber will forfeit the use of their subscription for the period
          of the suspension and shall not be entitled to receive a refund of the
          subscription fee or an extension to the duration of their
          subscription. You understand that if the payment card we have on
          record for you is unavailable (in that we cannot successfully charge
          the applicable renewal fee), or if we don’t have any stored payment
          card details for you, then your subscription shall be automatically
          suspended. Your subscription shall not become active again until you
          change or update your payment card details to a card that can
          successfully be charged the applicable renewal fee. If your
          subscription is suspended and you are a subscriber to a monthly Farmy
          Pass subscription scheme, then your monthly renewal dates over the
          minimum term and beyond, as applicable, will remain the same when your
          subscription becomes active again. All subsequent orders placed
          following any such suspensions will be subject to Farmy’s delivery
          charges applicable at that time. Our failure to insist upon or enforce
          your strict compliance with these Terms will not constitute a waiver
          of any of our rights. Farmy reserves the right to make improvements or
          changes to these Terms &amp; Conditions at any time (including without
          limitation the correction of errors, omissions, inaccuracies or
          ambiguities and to meet legal or regulatory requirements). If we make
          any material changes then we will contact you by email giving you 7
          days notice of any such changes. If any of these conditions shall be
          deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition
          shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and
          enforceability of any remaining condition.

        <h3 id='concluding-provisions'>13. CONCLUDING PROVISIONS</h3>
        <p>
          The provisions of the Swiss Code of Obligations apply. Zurich is the
          exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes arising from a contract with
          Farmy. We reserve the right to amend these terms and conditions at any
          time. The relevant legally binding version of the GTC is available on
          www.farmy.ch.
        </p>

        <h3 id='right-of-return'>14. RIGHT OF RETURN</h3>

        <p>
          14.1. You have the right to return delivered goods within 14 calendar
          days upon the date of delivery. In order to abide by this cooling-off
          period, you must inform us before the termination of the cooling-off
          period that you are availing yourself of your right of return. The
          deadline is met when the goods are handed over to the post office or
          another mail-order establishment or one of our couriers on the last
          day of the deadline for the return. Comestible goods are excluded from
          the right of return.
        </p>

        <p>
          14.2. In case of an orderly return of the goods we will refund the
          full amount paid via credit voucher after having examined the goods. A
          refund is at all times carried out to the means of payment employed at
          the time of purchase. In case of possible refunds from purchases paid
          by invoice, we will refund the amount to the respective account.
        </p>

        <p>
          14.3. We can deny the refund until we have either retrieved the ware
          or until you have provided proof that you have returned the ware. You
          must return or hand over the goods immediately and in every case
          within 14 days at the latest starting from the day on which you have
          informed us about the revocation of this contract.
        </p>

        <h3 id='why-does-the-weight-of-certain-products-say-approximate'>
          15. Why does the weight of certain products say “approximate”?
        </h3>

        <p>
          Some of our fresh meat and fish products are portioned by hand
          especially for you and natural products such as fruits and vegetables
          vary in weight. Therefore, the exact price is not known in advance,
          which is why we initially charge 10-30 % more depending on the
          product. As soon as the exact weight and therefore the exact price is
          known, the difference will of course be credited to your Farmy account
          or charged directly to your payment method. The basic price stated per
          unit of measurement applies.
